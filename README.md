# Math-Starter

This app is for children who are just started to learn math. Here they will be able to learn four basic operations of Mathematics:  Addition, Subtraction , Multiplication and Division in interactive way.
They will also be able to practice those operations here.
While developing this application we tried to make this as simple as possible.
